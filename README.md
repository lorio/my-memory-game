## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I converted this from a static project to an interactive, responsive one, modifying the HTML and CSS files a bit, and creating the JavaScript file from scratch, building out the app's functionality, following the project's rubric in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Dependencies

Bootstrap Font Awesome library

## Contributing

This repository is the finished code for my Udacity project submitted for my nanodegree course.
